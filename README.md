# Data_Science_Work
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive collection of my work during a 1-year Data Science course under the expert mentorship of Dr. Radhakrishnan Naik, a Senior Data Scientist. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with real-world problems and concepts that are core to becoming a data science professional.

# Programming for Data Science
1.Python (Core + Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# SQL (Data querying from relational databases)

# Statistics & Probability
1.Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, mode, std. deviation)
2.Inferential Statistics (confidence intervals, z-test, t-test, chi-square test)
3.Probability Theory (Bayes theorem, conditional probability)
4.Hypothesis Testing (null/alternate hypothesis, p-values, errors)

# Mathematics for Data Science

5.Outlier Detection

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1.Data Profiling
2.Visual Analysis using Matplotlib/Seaborn
3.Correlation Analysis


# Data Visualization
1.Dashboards with Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib


# Machine Learning (ML)
➤ Supervised Learning

3.RNN (for sequences/text)
4.Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

# Big Data Technologies
1.Hadoop Ecosystem 
2.Apache Spark (PySpark)
3.NoSQL Databases (MongoDB)


You can see all these as a Data Science Path which i learn from my teacher..

I am sharing all my assignments and tests which i did...if you need notes or codes of all these stuff you can connect  with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/hardik-sonawane-baa701288?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app
